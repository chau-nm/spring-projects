SPRING BOOT APPLICATION USING HATEOAS

HATEOAS : Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State

As per wikipedia - 
1. HATEOAS is a constraint of the REST application architecture that distinguishes it from other network application architectures.
2. With HATEOAS, a client interacts with a network application whose application servers provide information dynamically through hypermedia.
3. A REST client needs little to no prior knowledge about how to interact with an application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia.
